# Why This Project Exists

If you come from a poor or middle-class family, freedom of speech and human rights are often the only protections you have. So why not defend them as much as you can?

You could be a journalist, a civilian, or anyone who dares to speak the truth. If you live under an authoritarian state or in a country that is sliding toward authoritarianism, where government surveillance threatens your life or the lives of your loved ones simply because of your criticism, then this project shows a method to safely communicate and share files with people that you care without exposing yourself to unnecessary risks.

# What This Project Demonstrates

This project is not about hacking or illegal activity. Instead, it demonstrates practical techniques for censorship-resistant and anonymous communication, inspired by how people in restrictive environments protect their freedom of expression.

The project covers four main areas:

1. Anonymous Operating System (Tails OS)
 - Running a live, amnesic operating system from USB.
 - Leaves no trace on the host machine.
 - All Internet connections are forced through Tor.

2. Secure File Sharing (OnionShare)
 - Create temporary Tor-based file-sharing services.
 - Send or receive documents without using centralized servers.
 - No metadata leaks (like IP addresses or accounts).

3. Decentralized Messaging (Briar)
 - Peer-to-peer messaging app that works over Tor, Wi-Fi, or even Bluetooth.
 - Useful in environments where the Internet is censored or shut down.
 - Designed for journalists, activists, and citizens under surveillance.
   
4. Steganography (Steghide)
 - Hiding sensitive messages inside harmless-looking files (e.g., images, MP3s).
 - Only someone with the correct passphrase can extract the hidden content.
 - Demonstrates how information can be disguised to bypass censorship.
