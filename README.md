# Privacy-From-Surveillance

# Why This Project Exists

If you come from a poor or middle-class family, freedom of speech and human rights are often the only protections you have. So why not defend them as much as you can?

You could be a journalist, a civilian, or anyone who dares to speak the truth. If you live under an authoritarian state or in a country that is sliding toward authoritarianism, where government surveillance threatens your life or the lives of your loved ones simply because of your criticism, then this project shows a method to safely communicate and share files without exposing yourself to unnecessary risks.
